# Easy packages

- **Easy Packages**: A Flutter framework offering a comprehensive suite of UI and UX components, logic modules, and more. Designed for rapid and robust app development across various domains.

- The framework consists of multiple small packages, each with its own unique functions. These packages can operate independently, allowing you to use them individually in your app. Additionally, all the packages are designed to work seamlessly together.

- This framework supports many features using the Flutter Firebase Client SDK, except for those that can't be implemented with it. For example, previously, push notifications were sent from Firebase Cloud Functions (backend) because it was more efficient than handling them in Flutter (client side). However, with the `easy_packages`, push notifications are now managed entirely from the Flutter side, even if it's not as efficient.
