# Easy Report


`easy_report` package provides an easy way of reporting and managing users, posts, comments, photos, chat, and whatsoever.

It also provides a way of listing and blocking users.



## Concept

- It does not require typing to avoid the inconveniencing the user. Instead, it ask users to press a button for the reason of the report. And it offers three options. `Spam`, `Abusive`, `Other` and I think these are enough.

- It saves the user's uid and the document reference of the reporting. The document may be in any form (containing any fields).

- In admin screen, it displays the texts and uploads on the screen and let the admin choose to block the user or not.
